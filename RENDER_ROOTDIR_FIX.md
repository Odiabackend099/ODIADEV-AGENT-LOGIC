# Render RootDir Fix

## Issue

Error:
```
Service Root Directory "/opt/render/project/src/ backend" is missing.
cd: /opt/render/project/src/ backend: No such file or directory
```

Notice the **space** before "backend" in the path - this indicates a formatting issue.

## Cause

Render was reading `rootDir` with an extra space, likely due to:
- YAML formatting issue
- Extra whitespace in the value
- Invisible characters

## Fix Applied

1. **Rewrote `render.yaml`** with clean formatting
2. **Verified `rootDir` values** are exactly:
   - `backend` (no spaces)
   - `rasa-agent` (no spaces)
3. **Removed any trailing/leading whitespace**

## Verification

The `render.yaml` now has:
```yaml
rootDir: backend       # ✅ No spaces
rootDir: rasa-agent   # ✅ No spaces
```

## After Fix

1. **Changes pushed to GitHub**
2. **Render will auto-detect** the fix
3. **Retry deployment** - should work now

## If Still Having Issues

If Render still sees a space:

1. **Check in Render Dashboard:**
   - Go to service settings
   - Check "Root Directory" field
   - Ensure it's exactly `backend` (no spaces)

2. **Manual Fix:**
   - In Render dashboard, manually set Root Directory to `backend`
   - Don't rely on Blueprint for rootDir if it keeps adding spaces

3. **Alternative: Remove rootDir from Blueprint**
   - Edit `render.yaml` to remove `rootDir` lines
   - Use `cd backend` in build commands instead
   - But this is less clean

## Current Status

✅ Fixed and pushed to GitHub
✅ Clean rootDir values verified
✅ Ready for retry
