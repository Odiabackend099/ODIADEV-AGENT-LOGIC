# Redis IP Allow List Fix

## Issue

Render Blueprint validation error:
```
services[3]
must specify IP allow list
```

## Cause

Render requires Redis services to specify an IP allow list for security. This controls which IP addresses can connect to the Redis instance.

## Solution

Added `ipAllowList: []` to the Redis service in `render.yaml`.

### Options for IP Allow List:

1. **Empty array `[]`**: Allows connections from all Render services in the same workspace (recommended for internal use)
2. **Specific IPs**: Add IP addresses that can connect
3. **CIDR blocks**: Specify IP ranges

### Current Configuration:

```yaml
- type: redis
  name: redis-cache
  plan: starter
  maxmemoryPolicy: allkeys-lru
  ipAllowList: []  # Empty = allow all Render services
```

This allows:
- ✅ All services in your Render workspace to connect
- ✅ Backend service can use Redis for session storage
- ✅ Secure internal network communication

## After Fix

1. **Pull latest changes** (Render should auto-detect)
2. **Retry Blueprint deployment**
3. **Verify** Redis service is created successfully

## Security Note

- `ipAllowList: []` is safe for internal Render services
- Redis is not publicly accessible by default
- Only services in your workspace can connect
- For external access, add specific IPs
